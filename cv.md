## Brief Self-Introduction

Hello! My name is Aleksey, and I’m excited to begin my career in frontend development. Although I don’t have a formal background in IT, I’ve always been fascinated by technology and how it shapes our daily lives. This curiosity led me to explore coding on my own, and I quickly discovered a passion for creating websites and web applications.

I’m currently focused on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve completed several online courses that have helped me build a solid foundation. I love the challenge of solving problems and designing intuitive user interfaces that provide a great experience for users.

One of my strengths is my creativity, which I believe is essential for crafting visually appealing and functional designs. I’m also a quick learner and thrive in environments where I can collaborate with others. I’m eager to connect with experienced developers, gain hands-on experience, and contribute to exciting projects.

As I take my first steps into the tech industry, I’m looking forward to continuous learning and growth. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!
